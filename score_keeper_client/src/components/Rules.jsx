        <p className='rules'>Badminton singles is a racket sport played on a rectangular court, with players hitting a shuttlecock over a high net. The game is played either in best-of-three or best-of-five sets, with each set played to 21 points.</p>
        <p className='rules'>Here are the basic rules for badminton singles :-</p>  
        <br/><p className='rules'>1. <span>Court Dimensions </span>: The court is 13.4 meters long and 5.18 meters wide, with a net in the center that is 1.55 meters high at the edges and 1.524 meters high at the center.</p>
        <p className='rules'>2. <span>Scoring </span>: A point is scored when the shuttlecock lands in the opponent's court, or when the opponent makes a fault. The player who reaches 21 points first (with a margin of at least two points) wins the set. If the score is tied at 20-20, the game continues until one player has a two-point lead.</p>
        <p className='rules'>3. <span>Service </span>: The server must stand inside the service court (a smaller rectangular area within the court) and hit the shuttlecock diagonally to the opponent's service court. The server must keep both feet on the ground and cannot touch the court boundary lines while serving.</p>
        <p className='rules'>4. <span>Faults </span>: A fault is committed if the shuttlecock lands outside the court, the shuttlecock fails to cross the net, the shuttlecock hits the ceiling or wall, the player touches the net or the opponent's court with their body or racket, the player obstructs the opponent's movement or vision, or the player hits the shuttlecock twice in a row.</p>
        <p className='rules'>5. <span>Change of Ends </span>: After every set, the players change ends of the court. If there is a third set, the players also change ends when the first player reaches 11 points.</p>
        <p className='rules'>6. <span>Timeouts </span>: Each player is allowed one minute of timeout per set.</p>
        <p className='rules'>7. <span>Winning the Match </span>: The player who wins the best-of-three or best-of-five sets wins the match.</p>
