With Score Keeper, people can view live news regarding sports and badminton in the news section of the website. People can even purchase badminton related products in the shop section which takes them to the same product on amazon, which is an affliate link which helps me earn money through [Amazon Affiliate](https://affiliate-program.amazon.in/) .

What problem does it solve?

As I am a Badminton Player I noticed that people use pen and paper to record live scores of a badminton match and later convert it to excel sheets and save it for their future reference. So from Score keeper I reduced the unnecessary use of paper and the strain of updating the scores in excel sheets.
